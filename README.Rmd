timefuzz
========

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE
)
```

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ropenscilabs/timefuzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ropenscilabs/timefuzz)

Time travel to test time dependent code - a port of Ruby's [timecop](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop)

**BEWARE: VERY ALPHA**

Package API:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
cat(paste(" -", paste(sprintf("`%s`", getNamespaceExports("timefuzz")), collapse = "\n - ")))
```

Features supported:

- freeze: freeze time to a specific point

Hope to support soon:

- travel: travel back to a specific point in time, but allow time to continue moving forward from there
- scale: scale time by a given scaling factor that will cause time to move at an accelerated pace

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/timefuzz")
```

```{r}
library("timefuzz")
```

## freeze

### freeze with a code block

```{r}
library(timefuzz)
library(clock)
library(testthat)
```

`book_due()` is a toy function that tells us if a book is due

```{r}
book_due <- function(due_date = Sys.Date() + 10) {
  as.POSIXct(clock::clock()$date()) > as.POSIXct(due_date)
}
```

Given the due date of `r Sys.Date() + 10` the book is not due

```{r}
expect_false(book_due()) # FALSE
```

Create a `time_fuzz` object

```{r}
x <- time_fuzz$new()
x
```

Call `freez()`, passing the date you want to freeze time to, and then a code block to run
in the context of that frozen time. Here we'll freeze time to today + 450 days

```{r}
x$freeze(Sys.Date() + 450, {
  expect_true(book_due())
})
```

`book_due()` results in `TRUE` now, whereas it was `FALSE` above in real time

### freeze without a code block

```{r}
x <- time_fuzz$new()
## set to today + 450 days
x$freeze(Sys.Date() + 450)
```

We're in the freezed date. So any time based actions using the [clock][] package 
are now using your frozen time context.

```{r}
clock_now()
```

call `$unfreeze()` to unfreeze

```{r}
x$unfreeze()
```

now we're back in current time

```{r}
clock_now()
```
